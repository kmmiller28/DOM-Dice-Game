# DOM-Dice-Game

#GAME RULES:
-The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
-In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result gets added to his ROUND score
-BUT, if the player rolls a 1, his entire ROUND score gets lost. Also, if the player rolls two 6's in a row, his ROUND score gets lost.
-The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
-The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
-This project was to further my skills with javascript and learn various concepts ranging from DOM manipulation, Event Handling, DRY  principle, and more.
